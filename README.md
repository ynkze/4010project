# SecureFiles
 This project is about designing a secure file-sharing platform with untrusted intermediary. This can be similar to Dropbox, but without trusting the cloud platform.

 ## Motivation

This project consists of the following motivation:

o User management module needs to be authenticated to ensure entity authentication and non-repudiation.
o File sharing should follow end-to-end encryption so that the platform does not see unencrypted shared files.
o Confidentiality and Integrity of the shared files must be assured even in case of attacks on the intermediary.
